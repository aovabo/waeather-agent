Mastra is a powerful TypeScript-based application that empowers you to create, customize, and deploy your very own AI agents. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with AI, Mastra provides a flexible and user-friendly platform to build intelligent automation tailored to your specific needs.

## Key Features

1.  **LLM of Your Choice:**
    *   Mastra is designed to be versatile, allowing you to integrate the Large Language Model (LLM) that best suits your requirements.
    *   Connect to any compatible LLM API and leverage its natural language understanding and generation capabilities within your agents.

2.  **Custom Tools:**

    *  Create different agents for different tasks.

4. **Sample Weather Agent:**
    *   Get started quickly with a built-in sample agent designed to fetch and provide weather information.
    *   This example showcases how you can structure an agent, connect it to an external data source (e.g., a weather API), and allow it to respond to user requests.
    *   Use this example as a base to create your own agent!

5. **TypeScript Foundation:**
    *   Mastra is built using TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript.
    *   Benefit from improved code maintainability, early error detection, and enhanced tooling support.
